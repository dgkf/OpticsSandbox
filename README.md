# OpticsSandbox
A simulation of light paths through optical elements for educational purposes.

### Usage For Deployment
Add an opticsSandbox div to an html document. This is used as an anchor to build the rest of the html elements from within javascript.
``` html
<div class="opticsSandbox"></div>
```
Include necessary scripts and style files in the .html document.
``` html
<script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="js/opticsModel.js"></script>
<script src="js/loadSandbox.js"></script>
<link href="css/opticsSandboxStyle.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned directory
3. Run ```python OpticsSandboxLocalDemo.py```

### Development Notes
I'm using this project to learn Javascript and web app development. Over the course of the project I've learned a lot about best practices that I was not aware of at onset. I realize that there are some poor coding practices used, and I intend to refactor those elements to better organize the project. For the time being, my main focus is on reaching my first feature milestone.
